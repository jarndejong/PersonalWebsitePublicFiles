# Public files for personal website
This is a repository for the public files of my personal website, which can be found at:

[jarndejong.nl](jarndejong.nl)

## Source
The website is build using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It uses the [hugo-profile](https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile) template; a few lingering files from that template might remain but they are deleted as they are found.

This repository does not contain any of the source files, these can be found in [this repository](https://git.jarndejong.nl/Jarn/PersonalWebsite)

# Online repository
The publicly available repository on GitHub (i.e. available [here](https://github.com/jarndejong/PersonalWebsitePublicFiles); most likely currently viewing this one) is an automated mirror from a private, self-hosted git repository.
